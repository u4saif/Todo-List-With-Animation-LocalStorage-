Todo-List With Animation &amp; LocalStorage 

In this projet I have Demostrated how to use Animation and local storage in angular environment.
User can save the Do to work list in and when ever user try to make changes in it that gets saved automaticaly in local storage. 
Please see the live example it is really very cool to see the animation in angular app.
